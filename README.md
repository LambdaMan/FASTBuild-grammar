# FASTBuild-grammar

Textmate compatible grammar for FASTBuild (see https://github.com/fastbuild/fastbuild).

This grammar can be used in various editors, including Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, to provide syntax highlighting for BFF files.
Currently support FASTBuild version 0.99.

## Scope names

This grammar does not try to provide general scope name for immediate use in a given editor. Instead, specific and (hopefully) logical names are assigned. This means that you most probably need a proper plugin or a `tmTheme` file along with it to get the desired result.

## Contribution guidelines

Pull requests are welcome but should target the YAML version of the file (as the other are generated from the YAML file).
